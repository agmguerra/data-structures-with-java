**Observações**
===============

 

-   BFS e DFS are alternatives algorithms to traverse a graph

-   DFS is likely more efficient

-   BFS will find the minimun number of edges

-   Other algorithms are used to solve other problems for exemplo shortest path

-   Since BFS searches level by level, it is guaranteed to find the shortest
    path from *s* to *d* when the graph is unweighted
